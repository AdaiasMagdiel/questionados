Welcome to Questionados, an exciting trivia game where up to 6 players can engage in a battle of wits! The objective is to answer questions from various categories, earn medals, and be the first to fill your collection with medals from all categories to become the ultimate Questionados champion.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Character:** Each player starts by choosing a unique character at the beginning of the game.

2. **Spin the Roulette:** Take your turn by spinning the roulette. The roulette will determine the category of the question you need to answer.

3. **Answer the Question:** Once the category is determined, answer a trivia question from that category. If you answer correctly, you earn a medal for that category.

4. **Collect Medals:** The goal is to collect medals from all categories. The first player to fill their collection with medals from each category wins the game!
